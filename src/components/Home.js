      Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement. Math
      is all around us, in everything we do. It is the building block for everything in our daily
      lives, including mobile devices, computers, software, architecture (ancient and modern), art,
      money, engineering and even sports. Since the beginning of recorded history, mathematical
      discovery has been at the forefront of every civilized society, and math has been used by even
      the most primitive and earliest cultures. The need for math arose because of the increasingly
      complex demands from societies around the world, which required more advanced mathematical
      solutions

      In many cultures—under the stimulus of the needs of practical pursuits, such as commerce and
      agriculture—mathematics has developed far beyond basic counting. This growth has been greatest
      in societies complex enough to sustain these activities and to provide leisure for
      contemplation and the opportunity to build on the achievements of earlier mathematicians.
      Before the Renaissance, mathematics was divided into two main areas: arithmetic, devoted to
      the manipulation of numbers, and geometry, devoted to the study of shapes. There was also some
      pseudoscience, such as numerology and astrology, that were not clearly distinguished from
      mathematics. Around the Renaissance, two new main areas appeared. The introduction of
      mathematical notation led to algebra, which, roughly speaking, consists of the study and the
      manipulation of formulas. Calculus, a shorthand of infinitesimal calculus and integral
      calculus, is the study of continuous functions, which model the change of, and the
      relationship between varying quantities (variables). This division into four main areas
      remained valid until the end of the 19th century, although some areas, such as celestial
      mechanics and solid mechanics, which were often considered as mathematics, are now considered
      as belonging to physics. Also, some subjects developed during this period predate mathematics
      (being divided into different) areas, such as probability theory and combinatorics, which only
      later became regarded as autonomous areas of their own.
