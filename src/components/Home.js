      Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement. Math
      is all around us, in everything we do. It is the building block for everything in our daily
      lives, including mobile devices, computers, software, architecture (ancient and modern), art,
      money, engineering and even sports. Since the beginning of recorded history, mathematical
      discovery has been at the forefront of every civilized society, and math has been used by even
      the most primitive and earliest cultures. The need for math arose because of the increasingly
      complex demands from societies around the world, which required more advanced mathematical
      solutions
      <br />
      <br />
      In many cultures—under the stimulus of the needs of practical pursuits, such as commerce and
      agriculture—mathematics has developed far beyond basic counting. This growth has been greatest
      in societies complex enough to sustain these activities and to provide leisure for
      contemplation and the opportunity to build on the achievements of earlier mathematicians.
